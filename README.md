# IDPA Visualization Project
This repository contains code developed for our final thesis, called IDPA, as part of the Swiss Berufsmatura program. The thesis explores the theme of satisfaction in a home office setting. The code is primarily used to generate various graphs and charts to visually analyze and represent the data collected for this study.

## Project Overview
Our IDPA thesis project aims to examine factors influencing satisfaction in remote work environments. The visualizations created with this code help illustrate trends and insights related to different demographic groups, frequencies of remote work, and their correlations with satisfaction levels.

##  Data Privacy
Due to data protection requirements, I am unable to upload the raw results from our survey forms. However, I might upload the full thesis document, which will include summaries and visualizations derived from this code, at a later stage.

## Code Overview
This project uses Python with libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for data processing and visualization. The sample code provided in this repository includes:

Reading data from Excel files
Generating box plots to analyze relationships, such as age vs. work frequency
The repository contains code for various charts and visualizations, which are useful for our analysis and presentation needs.

### Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib
```

## Usage
Run the script to generate visualizations. The generated charts will be saved as high-resolution images suitable for inclusion in reports and presentations.
